## What's New in v3 üöÄ (Working in Progress)

- **üî• rmz Support**: Use `rmz` for up to 3x faster file deletion
- **üõ†Ô∏è DevContainer**: Full development environment with Docker-in-Docker
- **‚úÖ Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated code quality checks with shellcheck and actionlint
- **üì¶ Workflow Templates**: Refactored tests using reusable workflows
- **üîß Better Error Handling**: Improved validation and error messages
- **üìù Enhanced Documentation**: Complete API reference and examples

### Migration from v2 to v3

The v3 is fully backward compatible with v2. To migrate:

```yaml
# Before (v2)
- uses: endersonmenezes/free-disk-space@v2
  with:
    remove_android: true

# After (v3) - works the same
- uses: endersonmenezes/free-disk-space@v3
  with:
    remove_android: true
    
# After (v3) - with new features
- uses: endersonmenezes/free-disk-space@v3
  with:
    remove_android: true
    rm_cmd: "rmz"        # NEW: Faster deletion
    rmz_version: "3.1.1" # NEW: Specify rmz version
```

**Breaking Changes:** None! All v2 configurations work in v3.

**New Optional Parameters:**
- `rm_cmd`: Choose between `rm` (default) or `rmz` (faster)
- `rmz_version`: Specify rmz version when using `rm_cmd: rmz`

## Inspiration

Free Disk Space Action are inspired by [jlumbroso/free-disk-space](https://github.com/jlumbroso/free-disk-space)

## Motivation

At work I came across a huge Docker image that still needed to be analyzed by a local security tool. This consumed the entire Runner and in addition to the repository I found, I needed to remove some packages, which led me to create a modification of the original repository.

I will maintain a Stable version of this project.

## Quick Start

```yaml
name: Free Disk Space (Ubuntu)
on:
  - push

jobs:
  free-disk-space:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Free Disk Space
        uses: endersonmenezes/free-disk-space@v3  # Use @main for latest, @v3 for stable
        with:
          remove_android: true
          remove_dotnet: true
          remove_haskell: true
          remove_tool_cache: true
          remove_swap: true
          remove_packages: "azure-cli google-cloud-cli microsoft-edge-stable google-chrome-stable firefox postgresql* temurin-* *llvm* mysql* dotnet-sdk-*"
          remove_packages_one_command: true
          remove_folders: "/usr/share/swift /usr/share/miniconda /usr/share/az* /usr/local/lib/node_modules /usr/local/share/chromium /usr/local/share/powershell /usr/local/julia /usr/local/aws-cli /usr/local/aws-sam-cli /usr/share/gradle"
          rm_cmd: "rm"  # Use 'rmz' for faster deletion (default: 'rm')
          rmz_version: "3.1.1"  # Required when rm_cmd is 'rmz'
          testing: false
```

## Common Use Cases

#### Docker Build with Large Images
```yaml
- name: Free Disk Space for Docker
  uses: endersonmenezes/free-disk-space@v3
  with:
    remove_android: true
    remove_dotnet: true
    remove_haskell: true
    rm_cmd: "rmz"  # Faster cleanup
    
- name: Build Docker Image
  run: docker build -t myapp:latest .
```

#### Node.js Project with Many Dependencies
```yaml
- name: Free Disk Space for Node
  uses: endersonmenezes/free-disk-space@v3
  with:
    remove_android: true
    remove_haskell: true
    remove_packages: "google-cloud-cli azure-cli"
    
- name: Install Dependencies
  run: npm ci
```

#### Python Data Science Workflow
```yaml
- name: Free Disk Space for Python
  uses: endersonmenezes/free-disk-space@v3
  with:
    remove_android: true
    remove_dotnet: true
    remove_folders: "/usr/share/swift /usr/local/julia"
    
- name: Install Python Packages
  run: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### Performance Optimization with rmz

For faster file deletion, you can use `rmz` instead of the default `rm` command:

```yaml
- name: Free Disk Space (with rmz)
  uses: endersonmenezes/free-disk-space@v3
  with:
    remove_android: true
    remove_dotnet: true
    rm_cmd: "rmz"  # Faster deletion (~3x faster)
    rmz_version: "3.1.1"
```

**Note:** `rmz` is a Rust-based alternative to `rm`, providing significantly faster deletion for large directories. Learn more at [SUPERCILEX/fuc](https://github.com/SUPERCILEX/fuc).

_The time can vary according to multiple factors this estimed time based on the run: [#134](https://github.com/endersonmenezes/free-disk-space/actions/runs/16681335178/job/47220484686)_

_In our action you can see more folders and packages to delete, but is your responsibility to know what you are doing._

_Initially I created this project with the intention of doing all this and then being able to use Docker and Python, our tests will prove this._

## FAQ

**Q: Should I use rm or rmz?**
- Use `rm` (default) for compatibility and safety
- Use `rmz` when you need maximum performance

**Q: How much time does this save in my CI/CD?**
- Typical savings: 2-5 minutes per workflow run
- With rmz: Up to 3x faster deletion operations

**Q: Is it safe to remove all these packages?**
- The defaults are safe for most workflows
- Test with your specific needs first
- Use `testing: true` to see what would be removed

**Q: How can I debug issues?**
- Enable disk space logging before and after (see examples above)
- Use `testing: true` to see what would be removed without actually removing
- Check the [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for troubleshooting details
